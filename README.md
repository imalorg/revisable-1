# Révisable 1

This first version of a series of assemblages part of [1962](http://raphaelbastide.com/1962/), a research around versioned physical artworks, led by Raphaël Bastide since 2012. Révisable 1 focuses on making modifications of a versioned object accessible, and on the publication of its history. The artwork therefore questions both online and offline audiences and players by offering them a finite set of actions.

There is no hierarchy between the original and its modifications; only the creation of an archive, self-documented, open, and as “forkable” as a software.
