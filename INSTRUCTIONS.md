# Instructions
## On site intervention

Visitors present in the exhibition space can act on the installation by following the protocol:

1. Fill the form below describing your identity and your intervention on the piece
2. Give back the form to a member of iMAL
3. Wait for a notification by email about the validation or refusal of your intervention (technical impossibility or complete calendar)
4. Your intervention is exposed during a week at iMAL and archived online on this website.

## Online intervention

This kind of intervention requires the knowledge of the distributed revision control system Git.
It is possible for online visitors to clone the Git repository of "RÃ©visable 1" and submit  a pull request. The repository URL is: [https://github.com/imalorg/revisable-1/](https://github.com/imalorg/revisable-1/)  
The file to edit is named "PIECE" and located at the root of the repository.

## Advanced Intervention

A special format is used to describe the strokes strings can trace in a grid space.

A grid is composed by points that can be connected by strings. Each point of a grid can hold extremities of strings, part of strings, or nothing.

- Grid points are always named using numbers from top to bottom and left to right, such as occidental writing
- Order of the connection does not have any importance in the code, the same composition can be coded in two different ways

#### Code format

    C2/4:7:2:3:9:5:10/07-20-13
     a         b         c

a: Choice of the string.
b: Declaration of the path of the rigging
c: Date of the intervention based on the format: mm-dd-yy

#### Demo

    C1/6:9:28/15:14:27/07-20-13

#### Advanced compositions

Several strings can be used in the same composition consequently, each path must be declared after a [string choice](#string-choice) `C2/2:4:7`.

Strings can criss-cross from the front and the bottom. A crossing should be declared unsing parenthesis and the signs `<` and `>` will specify id the crissing occur respectively from front to behind or from behind to front.

    C2/1:8:10:(>1:8)11/C1/5:9/07-20-13
     a    b     c      d   e     f

a: Choice of the first string  
b: First string path  
c: The segment 10:11 of the first string cross the segment 1:5 from behind to front  
d: Choice of the second string  
e: Second string path  
f: Date of the intervention

The code above will produce the following composition:

#### String choice

- C1: Black elastic - [image](https://raw.github.com/raphaelbastide/1962/master/media/extra/doc-media/black-elastic.png)
- C2: 1.5m Red plait rope with golden hooks - [image](https://raw.github.com/raphaelbastide/1962/master/media/extra/doc-media/red-rope.jpg)

#### Alternative writing

In order to facilitate the versionning, the code format can be writen with one statement per line.

    C2/1:8:10:(>1:8)11/C1/5:9/07-20-13

is equal to:

    C2
